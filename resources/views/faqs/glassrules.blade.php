                                    This table represents an extract from AS1288-2006 and should be used as a guide only. Maximum areas do not take into account design wind
									pressures. To calculate minimum	glass thickness for stress at ultimate limit state and deflection at the
									serviceability limit state pressures, AS1288-2006 Supplement 1 must be used. For a complete version including minimum thickness of annealed glass,
									refer to the published standard.<br /><br />
									<small>Note: AS1288-2006 states that the maximum area for 3mm annealed (float) glass is: n 0.85m2 for monolithic annealed glass or; n 1.36m2 for annealed glass incorporated in an IGU.</small><br />

                                    In the above example, the product configuration on the left would be comprised of a combination of 4mm and 5mm monolithic
annealed (float) glass. However, if the same opening was replaced by a single fixed lite, the minimum glass requirement is 8mm
toughened glass at the very least.
As a result, the product on the right would, in most circumstances, be site glazed with additional costs (i.e. crane lift, on-site
labour) accounted for in the final price. Although more visually appealing, this product would be significantly more expensive due
to size restrictions imposed through AS1288-2006.

                                    The guide below outlines C-View’s direction in regards to restricted openings in all building types and exceeds requirements
prescribed in the Building Code of Australia.
									<ul>
										<li>Restricted openings apply when it is possible for a person to fall from an openable window, where the distance to the 
nearest surface level below (eg. ground, balcony, roof, pool) is 2700mm or greater (A); and</li>
										<li>Where the openable portion of a window is within 1000mm of the floor level (B), or the lowest part of the frame falls between 
150mm and 760mm of the floor level (C), the openable portion must be restricted to facilitate a 120mm opening.</li>
										<li>The above rules apply to any openable window (eg. louvre, awning, double hung) of any size located on an external wall.</li>
									</ul>

									<strong>Note:</strong> Where the openable portion of a window is permanently fitted with a safety grill or security screen so as to prevent access 
to the outside or where the openable portion of a window is equal to or above 1000mm from the floor level and no climbable 
horizontal elements (eg. transoms) exist below the openable portion within 150mm and 760mm from the floor level, no sash 
restriction is required.
