                                    As a general rule, increasing mass will improve sound insulation.
                                    Brick and concrete walls have stronger sound insulating values
                                    because they are of greater mass when compared to glass. But
                                    because we need glass to see through, to provide natural daylight
                                    and to enhance a buildings look and appeal, the need for greater
                                    sound control when using glass becomes more important.

                                    Sound reduction will improve with increased glass
thickness due to the greater mass involved;<br /><br />
                                    Sound reduction will decrease somewhat with increasingly
larger glass areas but not enough to make much difference
in the majority of architectural glass sizes;<br /><br />
                                    Sound reduction will improve with the use of laminated
glass due to the vibration dampening effect of the PVB
interlayer.<br /><br />
                                    Sound reduction will improve with the use of glass/
airspace combinations, but the performance is critically
dependent upon the width of the airspace. An airspace of
100mm is generally regarded as a minimum for reasonable
benefits at medium to high frequencies. The optimum
airspace is about 300mm.

                                    The RW Ratings refer to the measure of sound reduction through a wall or other building element. Since the sound reduction may be different at
different frequencies, test measurements are subjected to a
standard procedure which yields a single number that is about
equal to the average sound reduction in the middle of the
human hearing range.
