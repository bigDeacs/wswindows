									Many window and door companies operate essentially as middlemen, buying from the manufacturer, 
									marking-up and warehousing on a shelf until bringing the window to a customer's home or office. 
									<br /><br />At Manilla Glass, we are the manufacturer, making both home and office windows right here in our facility. 
									This allows us complete quality control, and gives us the ability to make sure the glass delivered and 
									installed at your home or business meets the highest standard.
